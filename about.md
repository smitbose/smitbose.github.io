Hello there everyone! The guy in the picture above is me. Although it isn't apparent from the picture, but  please don't shout in exclamation "Oh! You have white hair at such a young age" when you see me. Technically, you see, having white hair is not a sin, I hope you will realize some day.

Anyways, a bit formally, I am a third year undergraduate, Computer Science and Technology Student in Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur. My high school education was from Vivekananda Mission School, and I am an ISC 2013 passout. It was during these high school years, that I started taking coding seriously, and I eventually decided that Computer Science would be the field for me.

Apart from coding, I enjoy watching football, Manchester United being my most favourite team. Once upon a time i used to be both a good painter and a synthesizer player, skills that eventually got overshadowed by academics. My taste for reading has developed only recently, and I am a fan of science-fiction.
